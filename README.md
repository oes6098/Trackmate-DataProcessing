# Trackmate-Data-Processing
 Intended to extract, compile, and filter data from many results files generated by Fiji's TrackMate

1. Run TrackMate on Fiji, export Tracks output csv file on Display options page
2. Save each output file per movie in separate folder within directory (if you have 5 movies, have 5 folders with output csv file in each folder)
3. Run trackmateCompileFilterOutputData.py, choose directory which holds the individual folders that contain TrackMate output files, then input minimum track duration (sec) (this filters out all tracks below this number), then input column name of data metric you would like to extract (Ex. TRACK_MEAN_SPEED)
4. Program saves compiled and filtered data on csv file in the chosen directory
